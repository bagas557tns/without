  <span>A theorist is one who has been undone by theory. <br><br></span><span>Rather than the accumulation of theoretical tools and materials, models of analysis, perspectives and positions, the work of theory is to unravel the very ground on which it stands.  </span><span>To introduce questions and uncertainties in those places where formerly there was some seeming consensus about what one did and how one went about it. </span><span>In the context of a question regarding what an artist might be, I would want to raise the question of what a theorist might be, to signal how inextricably linked these existences and practices might be.  </span><span>The old boundaries between making and theorizing, historicizing and displaying, criticizing and affirming have long been eroded. </span><span>Artistic practice is being acknowledged as the production of knowledge and theoretical and curatorial endeavours have taken on a far more experimental and inventive dimension, both existing in the realm of potentiality and possibility rather than that of exclusively material production. </span><span>The former pragmatic links in which one area ‘serviced’ another have given way to an understanding that we face cultural issues in common and produce cultural insights in common. </span><span>Instead of ‘criticism’ being an act of judgement addressed to a clear cut object of criticism, we now recognize not just our own imbrication in the object or the cultural moment but also the performative nature of any action or stance we might be taking in relation to it. </span><span>Now we think of all of these practices as linked in a complex process of knowledge production instead of the earlier separation into creativity and criticism, production and application. </span><span>If one shares this set of perspectives then one cannot ask the question of ‘what is an artist?’ without asking ‘what is a theorist?’. </span><span>The narrative of theoretical unravelling, of being undone is a journey of phases in which the thought we are immersed in is invalidated. </span><span>Those moments of silent epiphany in which we have realized that things might not necessarily be so, that there might be a whole other way to think them, moments in which the paradigms we inhabit cease to be self legitimating and in a flash are revealed to be nothing more than what they are, paradigms.</span>
